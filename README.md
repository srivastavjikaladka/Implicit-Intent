This is a simple Jetpack Compose Android application demonstrating the use of Implicit Intents 
to perform common actions such as sending emails, opening URLs, and sharing text.

🚀 Features
📤 Send an email using external apps (e.g., Gmail)

🌐 Open websites in the browser

📲 Share plain text with other apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Messages)

📺 Open YouTube videos using intent filters

📌 What is an Implicit Intent?
An implicit intent doesn't specify the target component directly.
Instead, it declares a general action to be performed, and Android resolves it to an appropriate app.
